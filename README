Installation
------------

Before trying to install using the instructions found in the standard
INSTALL file, please use, alternatively:

autoreconf --install --symlink

or

aclocal && automake -a && autoconf

Cross-compilation
-----------------

If cross-compiling, you should install a crosscompiler, for example,
in Debian unstable amd64: gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf.

The configuration must be called with a build and host triplet, as for
example:

	./configure --build x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --host armhf-unknown-linux-gnueabihf

Caveat: the current Debian distribution, as of Thu Mar 19 2015,
supports cross-compilation in sid on an amd64 architecture; it is
possible that other combination of releases and architectures work but
not to my knowledge.

Packaging
---------

For the moment, this is implemented only for Debian. It is possible to
extend this for other packaging systems and/or other distributions.

	make package

+ Local Variables:
+ mode: text
+ End:
